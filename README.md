## What's GifSaver?

Only an Ubuntu user knows the true pain of not able set a Live Screensaver. So the GifSaver came to save ya'all! ðŸŽŠ

## How to Use it?

You can either run GifSaver with Python or use a pre-compiled binary!

The script takes 2 inputs from the user as follow:
```
usage: GifSaver.bin or GifSaver.py [-h] -f FOLDER [-t TIMEOUT]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FOLDER, --folder FOLDER
                        Path to GIF Folder
  -t TIMEOUT, --timeout TIMEOUT
                        Idle Timeout to Start Screensaver
```
For example
```
python3 path/to/GifSaver.py -f path/to/folder/where/GIFs/are/stored -t 120

or

./path/to/GifSaver.bin -f path/to/folder/where/GIFs/are/stored -t 60
```

## Adding to Start-up

In ubuntu, You can execute any command on start-up, so we can run our GifSaver on every boot without manually running it!
Just enter above command as a new startup application!

**Note: Make sure to give full path for startup command and test the command in terminal before adding!**
